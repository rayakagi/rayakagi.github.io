                <h3 class="h3">A little bit about me...</h3>
                <h4 class="h4">Hello, my name is Raymond Akagi and I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and am currently working toward finishing my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Cal Poly SLO. I am absolutely intrigued by how things work, especially mechanical systems and how each component or subsystem comes together to solve real problems, for real people, with real solutions. To learn more about my education, skills, or qualifications, please see my Background page.</h4>
                <h4 class="h4">Outside of academics, I enjoy playing soccer/futsal, lifting/cardio, hiking/backpacking, and really any form of outdoor activity. I enjoy cooking food and living an active and healthy lifestyle. To learn more about myself and my interests, please see the About Me page!!</h4>

                <h3 class="h3">What happened?</h3>
                <h4 class="h4">I am beginning my journey in June of 2020, and starting in early 2020 the entire world was affected by COVID-19. I won’t go into the details about this, but because of this event, the company I had intended to join after college found itself in a downturn and there was essentially a hiring freeze. This not only affected the company I was interested in, but also the entire industry and different industries as well including defense, H.V.A.C., Gas & Oil, and many more. I found the need to learn more skills to become more competitive in the job market and in the future. </h4>
                
                <h3 class="h3">Why Learn to Code?</h3>
                <h4 class="h4">Through my studies and daily life, I found that software had become absolutely essential to professional and everyday life. I wanted to learn more about how these systems came to fruition and what could be done in the future to improve on these systems to make the world a better place.</h4>
                <h4 class="h4">I saw the amazing things that could be built using programming. I want to build something that matters, is meaningful, is significant to me, and solves problems. I don’t necessarily see myself as “becoming a coder” rather I see myself as a “Problem Solver”, “Innovator”, or “Creator” who is learning these skills to increase my mental plasticity, encourage different ways of thinking, and learn tools to make my dreams become a reality. </h4>

              <h4 class="h4">I am currently working to learn how to code and documenting the journey so others may learn from my mistakes, as I know there will be many. </h4>
