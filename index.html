                <h4>Thesis</h4>
                        <p>
                            My thesis is related to Actuator Disk Theory in which I am rederiving the equations 
                            for use as an energy Extractor. The equations I am deriving will help model and predict 
                            certain parameters of importance which include Drag, Power output, and efficiency. These parameters will be determined
                            for ducted and un-ducted cases with the inclusion of losses due to swirl and viscous forces. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some applications for this work can be seen in need for energy extraction from fluids such as air or water. 
                            These equations can help model and predict performance characteristics for wind/water turbines or Ram-air turbines. 
                        </p>
